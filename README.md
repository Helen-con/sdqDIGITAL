# SDQ Digital Assessment

This project provides a browser-based version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
It guides the assessor through each of the 25 SDQ items one at a time, calculates subscale and total
difficulties scores, and generates an interpretation with an option to export the results as a PDF.

## Features

- Responsive single-question flow with progress tracking
- Automatic scoring for all SDQ subscales, including Total Difficulties
- Narrative interpretation highlighting areas that fall outside the normal band
- Exportable PDF report summarising scores and findings
- Ability to restart the assessment and capture a fresh set of responses

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Answer each question sequentially. The **Generate Results** button appears on the final item.
3. Review the calculated scores and findings.
4. Optionally export the summary as a PDF or start again to capture new responses.

> **Note:** Scoring bands reflect the UK SDQ guidance for ages 4â€“17. The digital tool supports
screening and discussion but does not replace clinical judgement.
